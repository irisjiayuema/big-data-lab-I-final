**MapResume** - an online application that accepts a resume and returns jobs that most closely match your profile. Your worry-free Co-op & job hunting helper.

### Notes:

- The `step1_process.py` is for encoding the job descriptions. This process can be relatively slow, and it is only performed when the dataset is updated, then the data is saved for later use. **So to save your time and ensure you have an enjoyable testing experience, please skip this step if you want to.**
