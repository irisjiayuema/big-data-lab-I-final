RN must be highly skilled and be able to handle emergencies that could arise for both patients. Nurses also teach new mothers how to properly care for both her newborn baby and herself.\n\nPostpartum nurses perform a lot of assessments on new moms to make sure they are healing and recovering properly after giving birth. This may involve checking cesarean incisions or monitoring vital signs, remove catheters, which may have been placed during a C-section, or change dressings and give pain medication and antibiotics as needed.\n\nIn addition to caring for the mother, postpartum nurses also monitor babies to make sure they are healthy. Besides monitoring the recovery and health of mom and baby, postpartum nurses often provide education. Caring for a brand new little person can be a bit overwhelming, especially for new parents who do not have any experience with babies. Postpartum nurses may instruct new parents on all aspects of taking care of their babies.

The family split their time between Los Angeles and San Francisco, with some other travel. We are looking for someone to build the foundations of an excellent broad and deep education with appropriate targets and pedagogical theory behind it.\n\nThe children have always been home schooled; by their parents, by a general tutor, and by a specialist math tutor. The parents would like to formalize their education at this stage, to encourage a separation of the roles of parent and teacher, and to provide for an easier transition into mainstream schooling if required in the future.\n\nSTUDENTS\n\nThere are two boys, aged 7 and 5. They both enjoy games, science, discovering how things work, and nature. Continuing to develop these aspects of their education, with an increased rigor is important to the parents.\n\nThe older boy is advanced in math and enjoys science and technology. He likes to build things, both physically and virtually. As well as the design and construction process he is also interested in understanding how things work; ranging across such areas as electronic circuits and the natural world to Minecraft objects.\n\nHe doesn’t currently choose to read for pleasure, but can when he sees a purpose, such as while playing games etc.\n\nHis younger brother is particularly interested in animals, particularly dinosaurs. His math and reading are at an age appropriate level as he starts his education journey.\n\nBoth boys have the expected response to learning at the moment - they can sometimes be reluctant to engage with more formal lessons, but they are naturally inquisitive and respond well to engaging, inspirational teaching.\n\nJOB DESCRIPTION\n\nThe tutor will be responsible for designing and implementing a suitable curriculum for the boys. The educational plan should emphasize STEM and reading..\n\nThe aspiration is that the boys have the educational framework and the opportunity to allow them to pursue their interests, which may of course be in some new topic they haven’t met yet, to a deeper level than would be possible in mainstream schools. It is likely that a project led approach will be the optimum approach.\n\nExperiential learning and the encouragement of an enquiring mind are to be encouraged, with opportunities for investigation and research being actively followed. The teacher will ideally be well placed to lead discussions on a wide range of topics as they arise, in science, the humanities, literature, and more generally.\n\nThis style of teaching requires someone who, as well as being knowledgeable and enthusiastic, is also organized and capable of maintaining progress towards long term goals without giving a sense of coercion. There are going to be times when the boys would rather not do an activity and the teacher needs to have strategies to get around this without being over controlling.\n\nAs well as more academic topics, the teacher will include real world activities in the program. For example, understanding money, shopping, cookery, budgeting, social situations can all be made into fun activities that reinforce curriculum content as well as having independent value.\n\nTeaching is to be delivered in English. The tutor must be completely fluent.\n\nThe successful candidate will be forward thinking, apolitical, tolerant and respectful towards others.\n\nJob Type: Full-time\n\nSalary: $75,000.00 - $100,000.00 per year\n\nBenefits:\n\nPaid time off\n\nSchedule:\n\nMonday to Friday\n\nEducation:\n\nBachelor's (Required)\n\nExperience:\n\nSTEM Teaching: 2 years (Required)\n\nLicense/Certification:\n\nTeaching Certification (Required)\n\nWork Location: In person\n\nReport", "Validate": "Private Teacher"}, {"Company": "L&T Precision Engineering", "Link": "https://www.glassdoor.ca/job-listing/lathe-cnc-programmer-l-and-t-precision-engineering-JV_KO0,20_KE21,50.htm?jl=1008924866429", "JT": "Lathe CNC Programmer", "Location": "San Jose, CA", "JD": "1.
